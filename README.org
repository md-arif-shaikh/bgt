~bgt~ (short for ~blood glucose table~) is an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] package to keep record and track blood glucose level
* Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package bgt
    :straight (bgt :type git :host github :repo "md-arif-shaikh/bgt")
    :config
    (setq bgt-file-name "/path/to/bgt.org")      ;; full name with path of the org file to save the glucose levels data
    (setq bgt-csv-file-name "/path/to/bgt.csv")  ;; name of csv file to export the org table 
    (setq bgt-python-file "/path/to/bgt.py")     ;; full path to the python script that comes with the package to plot the trend of glucose levels
    (setq bgt-python-path "/path/to/python"))    ;; path to the python program that runs the python script

* Requirements
The trend of glucose levels over the time could be seen by plotting the glucose leves vs time. For this we need
- [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] installed on your machine.
- [[https://matplotlib.org/][Matplotlib]], a plotting package for python and
- [[https://pandas.pydata.org/][Pandas]], a DataFrame tool for python.

* Usage
  - ~M-x bgt-add-entry~ to add an entry.
  - ~M-x bgt-view-entry~ to see the org table.
  - ~M-x bgt-plot~ to show trend.
